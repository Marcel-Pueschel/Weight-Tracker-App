Dear readers!
This is my first own app project after finishing the course "Dart & Flutter - Zero to Mastery [2023] + Clean Architecture".
Goal of this project was to apply the learnings I made in this course. At them moment the App provides all feautures(functional) I planed to implement.
For the future I will include Testing for the whole App and do some minor refactoring to make the code a little bit cleaner with more focus on seperation and reusability.
Since the course didnt covered any deeper dives into UI/UX design, I didnt prioritized it. But for the next couple of weeks I planned to work through some tutorials/courses which will deal with layout in general and best practices for UI/UX.

Thank you for your attention and have a nice day!
